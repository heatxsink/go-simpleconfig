go-simpleconfig
===============

A simple config file abstraction. Why? I kept having to write something like this over and over again. Sadly, I'm tired of having N versions/variations in various projects.

Description
-----------

There's a function called Load(filename, object) and a Save(filename, object). These functions do precisely what they are named.
